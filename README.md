Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. 

To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set.

## Libraries Used :
1) Pandas
2) Numpy
3) atplotlib.pyplot
4) Seaborn
5) sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
6) sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
7) sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score,f1_score
8) klearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
9) sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
10) sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

## Steps Involved :
1) EDA 
2) Building Decision Tree,
3) Building  Random Forest & 
4) Building  Logistic Regression Modeling

## Summary
Logistic Regression Confusion matrix is very similar to Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier.
In this analysis, we did extensive analysis of input data and were able to achieve Test Accuracy of  __86 %__
